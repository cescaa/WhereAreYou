                Robin was surprised at how public Jessica Bratford kept her profile. <br>
                She figured she would’ve wanted her personal life hidden from students, <br>
                even if most of her posts were just cat videos,<br>
                innocent memes only teachers would understand, <br>
                and stream of consciousness-esque status updates.

            <i>Lucky me</i>, Robin thought. Someone so open on Facebook, especially a teacher, would probably have less reservations revealing student information to a complete stranger. Robin sent her a message and attached the photo of her and Sam. What she was doing could be stalking, but at least Jessica would know it was for good intentions.<br><br>
            <img src="img/teacheremail.png" width="100%" id="mobilepic2">
            Her message back was polite, but sprinkled with enough kindness and emojis not to feel cold and distant. <br><br>

            <!-- FOURTH QUESTION START -->
            <span style="display: block; text-align: center;color: #60667E;">What high school extracurricular was Sam involved in? </span>

            <div class="question">

                <input id="guess-input4" type="text" name="photography club" value="" placeholder="Hint: Two words" />

        <h1>Another dead end.</h1>
        Finding Sam was starting to feel impossible. Robin stared at the teacher’s message and took a deep breath. Maybe she could find something about the contest, but where would she begin?

        <div id="searchImage"> <img src="img/searchbarfinal2.png" width="100%"></div>

        She opened another tab and typed <i>Martin Grove High School student photography winner</i> into Google. <br><br>
        94.4 million results in 0.74 seconds.
        That’s a start.<br><br>

        Robin scanned through them, clicking the ones that looked the most promising. On her 30th or so click, she found it. During Sam's senior year, she won a country-wide photography contest and the winning photo was featured in her local gallery.<br><br>

        And there it was—her last name—printed on the award she clutched close to her chest.<br><br>

        <!-- FIFTH QUESTION START -->
        <span style="display: block; text-align: center;color: #60667E;">What is Sam's last name?</span>

        <div class="question">

            <input id="guess-input5" type="text" name="kaur" value="" placeholder="Hint: One word" />
            <button id="guess-submit5" class="guess-submit5" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Submit</button>
