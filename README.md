# WhereAreYou
⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

Given that I worked on this project early in my JavaScript/front-end journey and this was my VERY FIRST attempt at jQuery,
I want to warn you that my code is somewhat redundant (WET), a bit disorganized, and it may give you a migraine. 🤦🏻‍♀️

Fret not, I plan to refactor and improve the code in the future!

However, I'm still immensly proud of this project, not only because of my contributions as a novice developer,
but also because of the remarkable results achieved through our collaborative efforts as a team.
